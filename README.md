# Document OCR and indexer

This is a simple little project for my personal use to watch a folder for new
image files, run an OCR over the image and index the text so that the image
can be later found by text search. It is the basis for a personal filing
system where I scan all documents that arrive by mail, drop the scans into
an inbox and they automatically end up indexed and stored on my computer. No
doubt this could be useful for many people but I'm just scratching my own
itch just now. If you like the look of it, get in touch!
